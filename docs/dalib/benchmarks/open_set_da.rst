Open Set Domain Adaptation
==========================================

We provide benchmarks of different domain adaptation algorithms on `Office-31`_ , `Office-Home`_ and `VisDA-2017`_ as follows.
Those domain adaptation algorithms includes:

-  :ref:`DANN`
-  :ref:`OSBP`


.. note::
    - ``Source Only`` refers to the model trained with data from the source domain.
    - ``OS`` means normalized accuracy for all classes including the unknown as one class.
    - ``OS*`` means normalized accuracy only on known classes.
    - ``UNK`` is the accuracy of unknown samples.

    In ``OS``, the accuracy of each common class has the same contribution
    as the whole ``unknown`` class. Thus we use ``H-score`` proposed by `CMU`_
    to better measure the abilities of different open set domain adaptation algorithms.

    .. math::
        \textit{H-score} = 2 \cdot \dfrac{ \textit{OS*} \cdot \textit{UNK} }{ \textit{OS*} + \textit{UNK} }

    The new evaluation metric is high only when both the ``OS*`` and ``UNK`` are high.

.. note::
    We report the best ``H-score`` in all epochs.

    DANN (baseline model) will degrade performance as training progresses, thus the
    final ``H-score`` will be much lower than reported.
    In contrast, OSBP will improve performance stably.

.. note::
    We conduct `21` class classification experiments in this setting (follows `OSBP`_).
