Regression Domain Adaptation
===============================================

We provide benchmarks of different domain adaptation algorithms on `dSprites`_.
Those domain adaptation algorithms includes:

-  :ref:`MDD`

.. note::

    - ``Origin`` means the accuracy reported by the original paper.
    - ``Avg`` is the accuracy reported by DALIB.
    - ``Source Only`` refers to the model trained with data from the source domain.
    - ``Oracle`` refers to the model trained with data from the target domain.


.. note::

    Labels are all normalized to [0, 1] to eliminate the effects of diverse scale in regression values.

    We repeat experiments on DD for three times and report the average error of the ``final`` epoch.
