class ImportanceWeightModule(object):
    r"""
    Calculating class weight based on the output of discriminator.
    Introduced by `Importance Weighted Adversarial Nets for Partial Domain Adaptation (CVPR 2018) <https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.09210>`_

    Args:
        discriminator (torch.nn.Module): A domain discriminator object, which predicts the domains of features.
            Its input shape is :math:`(N, F)` and output shape is :math:`(N, 1)`
        partial_classes_index (list[int], optional): The index of partial classes. Note that this parameter is \
            just for debugging, since in real-world dataset, we have no access to the index of partial classes. \
            Default: None.

    Examples::

        >>> domain_discriminator = DomainDiscriminator(1024, 1024)
        >>> importance_weight_module = ImportanceWeightModule(domain_discriminator)
        >>> num_iterations = 10000
        >>> for _ in range(num_iterations):
        >>>     # feature from source domain
        >>>     f_s = torch.randn(32, 1024)
        >>>     # importance weights for source instance
        >>>     w_s = importance_weight_module.get_importance_weight(f_s)
